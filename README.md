Project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I created a grid using a loop, then added an event listener to change the color of the grid squares when they are passed over.

Next I added a button to change the grid size from the default (16 x 16) to any number between 1 and 100.

Lastly I changed the color from black to a random color each time a square is passed over, using a function to select a random color.
